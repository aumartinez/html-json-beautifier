# html-json-beautifier
A JS tool to beautify JSON payloads

I had to manually submitt a list of data which I was pulling from a DB but only a few specific properties, the payload had a lot of html entities, escape characters and it was not indented, so after reading a few posts, I decided to make my own tool that helped to get this done in less than one hour
